# Hierarchical visualization of single-cell RNA-seq data

This repository contains my thesis, along with 
the relevant code and literature used for it. 

The thesis itself can be found on 
https://www.overleaf.com/read/bsdqzxcvhcgw

The folder 'TF-tutorials' contains some of the tutorials on TensorFlow 
Probability in jupyter notebook format. Literature is contained within 
the 'literature'-folder.
The 'Code'-folder is rather empty as of yet, but will contain the 
relevant code for my thesis.
