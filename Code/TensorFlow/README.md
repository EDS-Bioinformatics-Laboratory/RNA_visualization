# TensorFlow Probabilities

This folder contains all the programming performed in TensorFlowProbabilities (TFP).
This platform was tried first as the main tool to solve our models, but a change was made to use Stan instead. The code is still available in this directory.

The .ipynb files describe attempts to solve several statistical models using TFP.
The 'TF_tutorials' directory contains my approach to some of the tutorials listed at https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/overview.
