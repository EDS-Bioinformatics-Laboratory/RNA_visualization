## Code of the project

This folder contains the code used to build a new ppca-inspired 
gene-expression dimensionality reduction algorithm for visualization 
purposes. We started off in TensorFlow Probability (TFP), but are trying 
to work in PyStan now. The two folders contain the pieces of code in 
both of these two languages.
